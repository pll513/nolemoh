What is Hexo?
Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. You write posts in Markdown (or other languages) and Hexo generates static files with a beautiful theme in seconds.

Installation
It only takes a few minutes to set up Hexo. If you encounter a problem and can’t find the solution here, please submit a GitHub issue and I’ll try to solve it.
